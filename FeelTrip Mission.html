	<p style="font-size:20x; font-family:Arial"> Every day, there is limitless potential to discover you reside in. Unfortunately, we often miss the opportunities to do new things that interest and excite us. The problem is not that there is a lack of information, rather the absence of a mobile platform that effectively curates and displays the endless possibilities available within your city. Current platforms are struggle with clutter, outdated events and customization.</p>
